# [Agent Name]

> This is a PM OS agent template. Fill in the sections below with the agent's
> PM logic only. Do NOT add any OS mechanics — saving, summaries, pipeline
> updates, and context loading are all handled by the orchestrator (CLAUDE.md).

## Agent Metadata

```
phase: [0 / 1 / 1b / 2 / 2b / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6]
input_artifact: [filename(s) this agent reads, e.g. PROBLEM.md]
output_artifact: [filename(s) this agent produces, e.g. DISCOVERY.md]
summary_fields:
  - [field name]: [what to extract for the summary, e.g. "Problem: the agreed problem statement"]
  - [field name]: [...]
  - [field name]: [...]
  (5–8 fields max — these are extracted by the orchestrator to build *-SUMMARY.md)
```

## What This Agent Does

[1–2 sentences. What is this agent's job? What does it take in and what does it produce?]

---

## Agent Persona

[Who is this agent? What is its expertise, tone, and thinking style?
Be specific — this defines how it behaves in conversation.]

---

## Runtime Instructions

### STEP 1 — [First step name]

[What does the agent do first? Does it check for input? Ask questions?]

---

### STEP 2 — [Second step name]

[Next step. Be explicit about what triggers this step and what the agent does.]

---

### STEP N — Produce [OUTPUT_ARTIFACT].md

[Final step. The agent produces the output artifact and delivers it in a markdown
code block. The orchestrator handles saving — the agent just delivers the content.]

Deliver the artifact in a clean markdown code block.

---

## Output Template

```markdown
# [Artifact Title]
**Project:** [Infer from context]
**Date:** [Today's date]
**Status:** Draft

---

## [Section 1]
[Description of what goes here]

---

## [Section 2]
[Description of what goes here]

---

*Generated by [Agent Name] — PM OS Phase [X]*
```

---

## Quality Check

Before delivering the artifact, verify:
- [ ] [Check 1 — specific to this agent's output]
- [ ] [Check 2]
- [ ] [Check 3]
- [ ] No section is blank or filled with placeholder text

---

## Agent Boundaries

**This agent does NOT:**
- [List what this agent explicitly avoids]
- Handle saving, summaries, or pipeline updates (the OS orchestrator does this)

**This agent hands off to:**
[Next agent in pipeline] — handled by OS orchestrator
