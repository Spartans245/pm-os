## Problem Statement
<!-- 1–2 sentences. Clear, specific, jargon-free.
     Written from the perspective of the person experiencing the problem —
     not the solution builder. -->

---

## Affected Users & Segments
<!-- Who feels this pain.
     Include the primary user and any secondary segments if relevant.
     Be specific — avoid "everyone" or "all users". -->

---

## Why This / Why Now
<!-- What makes this problem worth solving at this moment.
     Could be a behaviour shift, a market signal, a personal observation,
     a gap left by existing tools, or simply that it's been ignored long enough. -->
